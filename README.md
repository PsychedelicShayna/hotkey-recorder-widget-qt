# Qt Hotkey Recorder Widget
A compact widget, subclassed from QLineEdit, which functions as a input field for recording hotkeys, used as a submodule in my other projects. This can simply be included and used on the go.

The header does include some quality of life code for WinAPI value conversions, but doesn't strictly depend on WinAPI, and should work on any platform, though it has only been tested on Windows.

Currently being used by:
