# Qt Hotkey Recorder Widget
A compact widget, subclassed from QLineEdit, which functions as a input field for recording hotkeys. This is meant to be used as a submodule in other repositories, and when doing so, the "include" branch should be used convenience.

The header does include some quality of life code for WinAPI value conversions, but doesn't strictly depend on WinAPI, and should work on any platform, though it has only been tested on Windows.
